Dear DaSCH,
we are working on inseri and I wanted to show you how you can visualise data from Knora, queried with Gravsearch using inseri.

Next to an existing website of a project (for example Kuno Raeber), a user can create own collages and visualise data, also from different projects and different APIs (for example Europeana, e-codices, libraries, triplestores, etc), for his own need, for example for his/her research. The user can create own notes on the collages, and will be able to share it with colleagues, etc.

Please let me know if this is interesting for some of your projects and I would really enjoy some suggestions for other apps / other improvements, etc.
