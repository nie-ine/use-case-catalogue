Dear DaSCH,
we are working on inseri and I wanted to show you how you can visualise data from Knora, queried with Gravsearch using inseri.

Next to an existing website of a project (for example Kuno Raeber), a user can create own collages and visualise data, also from different projects and different APIs (for example Europeana, e-codices, libraries, triplestores, etc), for his own need, for example for his/her research. The user can create own notes on the collages, and will be able to share it with colleagues, etc.

For smaller projects that donâ€™t have an own frontend developer, inseri will be an option to create an own website, of course with limitations compared to a fully self written website, but those websites can be maintained in a central way and all components are reusable for upcoming projects.

Please let me know if this is interesting for some of your projects and I would really enjoy some suggestions for other apps / other improvements, etc.
