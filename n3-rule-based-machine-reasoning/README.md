## N3-rule-based machine reasoning
Further information is in the dedicated [repository](https://github.com/nie-ine/N3-rule-based_machine-reasoning).

Machine reasoning is applied for different purposes.

### Implementation of the RDF model theory:
Use case for *subclass of, subproperty of*, transitivity of *is part of* and others.

### Consistency check for user defined restrictions:
Use case for a restriction on the number (cardinality) of objects a certain subject instance can have for a certain relation (property).

### Temporal reasoning:
Use case for calendar conversions.
Use case for missing start or end of an event.

### Miscellaneous functionalities and calculations:
Use case for inferring an ordinal from an entity identifier.

The reasoner can be installed locally to try out the inferences yourself (see [repository](https://github.com/nie-ine/N3-rule-based_machine-reasoning)).
