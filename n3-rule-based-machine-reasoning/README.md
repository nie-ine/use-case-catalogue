Positioning information of machine reasoning in the NIE-project is in the [N3-rule-based machine reasoning](https://github.com/nie-ine/N3-rule-based_machine-reasoning) repository.


Machine reasoning is applied for different purposes.

###Implementation of the RDF model theory:
Use case for *sub-class of, sub-property of*, transitivity of *is part of* and others.

###Consistancy check for user defined restrictions:
Use case for a restriction on the number (cardinality) of object instances or values a certain subject instance can have for a certain relation (property).

###Temporal reasoning, essential in formal data processing:
Use case for missing start or end of an event.

###Miscellaneous functionalities and calculations:
Use case for inferring an ordinal from an entity identifier.


The reasoner can be installed locally to try out the inferences yourself.

Note: the command for the reasoner is written for Unix OS, but can be easily converted for Windows OS.
