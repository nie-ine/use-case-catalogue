Positioning information of machine reasoning in the NIE-project is in the [N3-rule-based machine reasoning](https://github.com/nie-ine/N3-rule-based_machine-reasoning) repository.

As an example of the implementation of the RDF model theory we show a reasoning case using the transitivity of the *is part of* relationship.

Consistancy to user defined restrictions can be checked upon, e.g. for cardinality on a certain relation (property). 

The reasoner can be installed locally to try out the inferences yourself.

Note: the command for the reasoner is written for a Unix OS, but can be easily converted for a Windows OS.
