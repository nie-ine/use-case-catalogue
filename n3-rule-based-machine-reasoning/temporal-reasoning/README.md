# Temporal reasoning:

See the repository [N3-rule based machine reasoning](https://github.com/nie-ine/N3-rule-based_machine-reasoning/tree/master).

One temporal reasoning use case is the [calendar unification](https://github.com/nie-ine/N3-rule-based_machine-reasoning/tree/master/temporalReasoning_calendarUnification). 

Another use case concerns an [event without a start or end date](https://github.com/nie-ine/N3-rule-based_machine-reasoning/tree/master/temporalReasoning_missing-start-or-end), with a specific example of missing birth- or death date.
