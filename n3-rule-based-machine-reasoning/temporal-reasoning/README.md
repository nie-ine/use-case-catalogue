# Temporal reasoning:
This type of reasoning is crucial for formal data to be reusable and interchangeable.  
Generally, time indicators are uniformly converted to intervals to calculate with.  

A temporal reasoning use case concerns an [event without a start or end date](https://github.com/nie-ine/N3-rule-based_machine-reasoning/tree/master/temporalReasoning_missing-start-or-end), with a specific example of missing birth- or death date.
